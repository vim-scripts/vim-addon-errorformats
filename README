Vim has the :compiler command built in. However sometimes you only want one or more error formats setup. That's what this plugin is about: It allows you to

:Errorformat ocaml-simple ruby
which will set 'errorformat' to ocmal-simple then amend ruby error format description.

This is useful if you build an ocaml project using the rake build system which is implemented in ruby
